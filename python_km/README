This Kiyo's code for processing GBT data.  This code depends on the Kiyo's
personal utilities package: kiyopy (available from github, user: kiyo-masui).

Ideally, any code pushed back to the github repository should be tested and
pass the test suit (python test_*) but this might not be true early on.
